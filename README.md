In Manual booking system all the bookings are done by filling in forms manually which are submitted to custodians therefore taking a lot of time to book a Private Hostel and PG meaning proformance of the current system is slow and insufficient. They face the problem of data accuracy and not being able to collect the required data in time . Both students and non students who want to stay in private hostel and PG have to come early enough and walk around looking for places to rent and do booking. Therefore it is necessary to develope an automated online system that assigns the Hostels and PGs automatically with the seller defined rules that track discredd details about of each client,update status each time a booking is made, save client's information into database.
